# airline-management
This project is done using java,mysql and contains functionalities  searching flights,book tickets,cancel tickets
I have attached a sql file so that you can run the file and create database.
Admin Details
username: admin
password: admin
One can use these admin details to add routes,flights,promocode,remove user,flights and update seats,price
Note that advance bookings can be made upto 1 week only.
Here I used promo codes also for discounts. All flights are non-stop flights having direct routes.
Tickets are also generated and can be cancelled.
